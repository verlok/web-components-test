# web-components-test

These are the web components I've created while following along a [course on Pluralsight on Web Components](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/vanilla-web-components-practical-guide/table-of-contents) by @RevillWeb.

In addition, I've experimented with [Declarative Shadow DOM](https://web.dev/declarative-shadow-dom/) by duplicating the `vrk-slide-menu` demo onto `vrk-slide-menu--declarative`.

Since browser support is currently limited to Chrome 90, the `vrk-slide-menu--declarative` also includes a 6-lines polyfill to work on all other browsers.

I've had fun playing around and learning very interesting, relatively new stuff!
